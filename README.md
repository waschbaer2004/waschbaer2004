- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @waschbaer2004
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python and the OS Linux Ubuntu, as well as the KDE Plasma desktop Enviroment.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Python.
- For some reason i have a own VM server. On this thing are some Servers, a Firewall, and some test Windows and Linux VMs.
- i am still looking how i can daily drive Linux, but i just cant live with all the compromises Linux based OSes are coming with. Razer Synapse is not working, and the JBL Quantum Software is not working either.
